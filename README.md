# HTML Portfolio Usability Test Assignment

This is the HTML code for a sample portfolio site I created as part of a usability testing assignment for Interactive Media Design.

The task for this assignment is to create an HTML5/CSS3 webpage with an option of using additional frameworks to create a mock portfolio website. Afterwards, a usability test is initialed on the initial website, which consists of various users testing the functionality and effectiveness of the website. After the testing phase, the site is then revamped to address any concerns and issues found within the initial site while implementing advanced CSS3/JS features that were taught in class (ie. transitions, Javascript, animations etc.)
